1. Block
2. Inline
3. Inline-Block


Block -> div, h1, h2, p...
         Full Space occupy (start from new line and at its end would be a new line)
         If you give width to it, then also next elements will start from new line

Inline -> span, a, img...
          occupy only required space
          No effect of width and height

Inline-Block -> Same as inline but can apply width and height
